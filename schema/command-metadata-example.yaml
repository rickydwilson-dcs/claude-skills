# Feature Prioritization Command

## Purpose

This command implements the RICE prioritization framework to help product teams make data-driven decisions about feature development. It analyzes feature candidates across four dimensions (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) and provides portfolio analysis to balance quick wins with strategic investments.

## Usage

### Basic Prioritization

```bash
/feature-prioritize features.csv
```

This will analyze all features in the CSV and output:
- RICE scores for each feature
- Portfolio categorization (Quick Wins, Big Bets, Fill-Ins, Money Pits)
- Recommended priorities

### With Capacity Planning

```bash
/feature-prioritize features.csv --capacity 20
```

This adds quarterly roadmap generation based on team capacity (person-months).

### JSON Output

```bash
/feature-prioritize features.csv --format json > results.json
```

Export results as JSON for integration with other tools.

## Input Format

The command expects a CSV file with these columns:

```csv
feature,reach,impact,confidence,effort
API Rate Limiting,1000,2,0.9,3
User Dashboard,500,3,0.8,5
Dark Mode,300,1.5,1.0,2
```

**Field Definitions:**
- **feature**: Feature name or description
- **reach**: Number of users affected per quarter
- **impact**: massive(3), high(2), medium(1.5), low(1), minimal(0.5)
- **confidence**: high(1.0), medium(0.8), low(0.5)
- **effort**: Person-months required (XL=6, L=3, M=1, S=0.5, XS=0.25)

## Output

### Portfolio Categories

**Quick Wins** (High RICE, Low Effort)
- Ship first to build momentum
- Validate prioritization process
- Quick value delivery

**Big Bets** (High RICE, High Effort)
- Strategic investments
- Require dedicated focus
- Plan for 1-2 per quarter

**Fill-Ins** (Medium RICE)
- Use to fill capacity gaps
- Nice-to-have improvements
- Buffer work items

**Money Pits** (Low RICE, High Effort)
- Avoid or re-scope
- Reconsider requirements
- Often driven by HIPPO decisions

## Workflows

### Quarterly Planning Workflow

1. Gather feature candidates from all sources
2. Score each with RICE parameters
3. Run `/feature-prioritize features.csv --capacity 20`
4. Review portfolio balance
5. Commit to Q1 features (quick wins + 1-2 big bets)
6. Plan Q2-Q4 with remaining priorities

### Stakeholder Alignment Workflow

1. Collect requests from stakeholders
2. Score objectively with RICE
3. Run prioritization analysis
4. Present data-driven results
5. Use scores to justify trade-off decisions

## Success Metrics

- **Decision Speed**: <2 days from backlog review to roadmap commitment
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: >90% agreement on priorities
- **Validation Rate**: 80%+ of shipped features match predicted impact
- **Portfolio Balance**: 40% quick wins, 40% big bets, 20% fill-ins
