See [Workflows](#workflows) section for detailed project initiation steps.

### 2. Execute Quarterly Portfolio Review

**Time:** 3 hours (planning) + 2 hours (meeting)

**Steps:**
1. **Prepare portfolio data** - One week before review meeting
   - List all active projects and major initiatives
   - For each project: status (green/yellow/red), % complete, key metrics
   - Budget tracking: spent vs. allocated vs. forecast
   - Timeline tracking: on-time vs. slipping milestones
   - Key risks and issues per project
   - Use Jira Expert to pull cross-project metrics
2. **Assess resource allocation** - Analyze if resources are optimal
   - How are engineers allocated across projects? (%)
   - Are there bottlenecks (one person on multiple critical projects)?
   - Are any projects under-resourced?
   - Do we have bench capacity or are we overallocated?
3. **Prioritize based on business value and strategic fit** - Evaluate project portfolio
   - High value + High strategic fit: Accelerate/Invest more
   - High value + Low strategic fit: Continue but limit expansion
   - Low value + High strategic fit: Maintain but don't expand
   - Low value + Low strategic fit: Consider terminating
4. **Identify cross-project dependencies** - Find risks
   - Does Project B depend on Project A finishing first?
   - Are teams waiting for other teams?
   - Are there shared resources causing contention?
   - Document dependencies and mitigation plans
5. **Create executive summary dashboard** - Prepare visualization
   - Portfolio status (X green, Y yellow, Z red projects)
   - Overall budget health (% spent, % remaining, forecast accuracy)
   - Timeline health (on-track vs. at-risk)
   - Resource utilization (% allocated, % available)
   - Top 5 risks
   - Use Confluence Expert to create dashboard page
6. **Conduct portfolio review meeting** - Present findings with leadership
   - Review portfolio health and trends
   - Discuss project prioritization and resource allocation
   - Make decisions on budget, timeline, or scope changes
   - Document decisions and communicate to stakeholders
7. **Communicate outcomes to teams** - Cascade decisions down
   - Share prioritization decisions
   - Communicate resource allocation changes
   - Explain timeline impacts or scope changes
   - Set expectations for next quarter

**Expected Output:** Clear understanding of portfolio health, optimized resource allocation, confirmed project priorities, and documented decisions on resource investment and timeline changes. Leadership aligned on strategy and resource deployment.

See [Portfolio Management](#workflows) section for detailed methodology.

### 3. Manage Risk and Issues Throughout Project Lifecycle

**Time:** 1 hour per month (ongoing)

**Steps:**
1. **Conduct risk identification workshops** - Monthly or quarterly (1 hour)
   - Gather project team in workshop format
   - Brainstorm potential risks: technical, resource, timeline, stakeholder
   - Capture risks without dismissing them
   - Examples: "Key engineer might leave", "Third-party API might be slow", "Executive sponsor changed"
2. **Assess probability and impact of each risk** - Rate and prioritize
   - Probability: Low (10%), Medium (50%), High (80%+)
   - Impact: Low (1 week delay), Medium (2-4 week delay), High (>4 week delay or project failure)
   - Priority = Probability × Impact
   - Focus on High probability × High impact risks
3. **Develop mitigation and contingency plans** - For top risks
   - Mitigation: How can we prevent or reduce this risk?
   - Contingency: What's our backup plan if it happens?
   - Owner: Who's responsible for managing this risk?
   - Example Risk: "Key engineer leaves" → Mitigation: Knowledge transfer, cross-training → Contingency: Hire contractor
4. **Track risks in risk register** - Maintain living document
   - Create in Confluence page or spreadsheet
   - Update monthly with new/closed risks
   - Track mitigation progress
   - Share with stakeholders
5. **Escalate critical risks to stakeholders** - Real-time alerts
   - When risk probability changes significantly → Notify sponsor
   - When risk has realized (became actual issue) → Escalate immediately
   - Propose mitigation or contingency plan
   - Get sponsor decision on response
6. **Close risks** - When mitigated or passed
   - Document how risk was resolved
   - Capture lessons learned
   - Maintain historical record for future projects

**Expected Output:** Comprehensive risk management process identifying threats early, developing mitigation plans, and preventing surprises. Stakeholders are informed and prepared for potential issues.

See [Risk Management](#workflows) section for detailed risk assessment framework.

### 4. Create and Present Stakeholder Status Report

**Steps:**
1. **Define reporting cadence and KPIs** - Establish expectations
   - Weekly: Brief team updates (5 mins)
   - Bi-weekly: Detailed team status (30 mins)
   - Monthly: Stakeholder business review (1 hour)
   - Quarterly: Executive strategic review (1.5 hours)
   - KPIs: What metrics matter to this stakeholder?
   - Example Executive KPI: Revenue impact, team velocity, on-time delivery
   - Example Team KPI: Burndown, velocity, bug rate, deployment frequency
2. **Gather metrics from team** - Collect data from Scrum Master and Jira Expert
   - From Scrum Master: Velocity trend, sprint completion %, team capacity changes
   - From Jira Expert: Issue metrics (created, resolved, overdue), velocity, burndown
   - From Engineering: Code quality, test coverage, deployment frequency
   - From Product: Feature completion, user impact, customer feedback
3. **Create executive summary** - 1-2 page executive overview
   - **Project Status (Red/Yellow/Green):** Is project on track? Why or why not?
   - **Key Accomplishments:** What did team complete this period?
   - **Upcoming Milestones:** What's coming next?
   - **Budget vs Actual:** Are we within budget?
   - **Timeline:** Are we on schedule? If not, what's the recovery plan?
   - **Blockers:** What's preventing progress and what's being done?
   - **Risks:** What could derail us and how are we mitigating?
4. **Build detailed metrics dashboard** - Multi-page detailed view
   - Sprint metrics: Velocity trend, burndown, completion %, story breakdown
   - Timeline: Milestone tracking, dependency status
   - Budget: Spend tracking, cost per feature, forecast vs actual
   - Quality: Bug trend, deployment frequency, incident rate
   - Team: Utilization, capacity changes, turnover risk
   - Use Confluence Expert to create dashboard page
5. **Prepare talking points and trade-offs** - Anticipate questions
   - "Velocity down 15% - why? Answer: Team member out on paternity leave, returning next sprint"
   - "Timeline at risk - what's the impact? Answer: Could be 2 weeks late, impacting Q4 release"
   - "Do we need more resources? Answer: Yes, one additional engineer would accelerate delivery by 3 weeks"
6. **Present to stakeholders with insights** - Not just data, but analysis
   - Start with business impact: "Revenue impact of 2-week delay is $500K"
   - Present trends not just snapshots: "Velocity stable for 5 sprints shows we're predictable"
   - Highlight wins: "Shipped payment feature 1 week early"
   - Propose actions: "Recommend hiring contractor to reduce timeline risk"
7. **Document decisions and communicate outcomes** - Record what was decided
   - Capture any scope changes, budget adjustments, timeline modifications
   - Communicate decisions to full team
   - Update risk register if decisions affect risks
   - File report in Confluence for historical record
