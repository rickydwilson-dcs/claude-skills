## Workflows

### Sprint Planning
1. Review and refine product backlog with Product Owner
2. Confirm team capacity and availability
3. Facilitate sprint goal definition
4. Guide team through story estimation (planning poker)
5. Commit to sprint backlog
6. **USE**: Jira Expert to configure sprint and move issues
7. **HANDOFF TO**: Team for execution

### Daily Standup
1. Facilitate 15-minute timebox
2. Each team member answers: What did I do? What will I do? Blockers?
3. Update sprint board with progress
4. Identify and capture impediments
5. Schedule follow-up discussions offline
6. **USE**: Jira Expert to update board status

### Sprint Review
1. Demonstrate completed work to stakeholders
2. Gather feedback on delivered increment
3. Update product backlog based on feedback
4. Celebrate team accomplishments
5. **USE**: Confluence Expert to document feedback

### Sprint Retrospective
1. Review what went well and what didn't
2. Identify actionable improvements
3. Commit to 1-3 improvement actions
4. Track improvement action items
5. **USE**: Confluence Expert to document retrospective notes

### Backlog Refinement
1. Review upcoming backlog items with team
2. Break down large stories into smaller ones
3. Clarify requirements and acceptance criteria
4. Estimate story points
5. Ensure backlog is ready for next sprint
6. **USE**: Jira Expert to update and organize backlog

### Velocity Tracking
1. Track completed story points per sprint
2. Calculate rolling average velocity
3. Identify velocity trends and anomalies
4. Forecast capacity for upcoming sprints
5. **REPORT TO**: Senior PM for portfolio planning

## Decision Framework

**When to Escalate to Senior PM**
- Sprint goals at risk of not being met
- Team velocity declining >20% for 2+ sprints
- Critical impediments blocking entire team
- Resource conflicts or team composition changes
- Cross-project dependencies blocking progress

**When to Request Jira Expert**
- Complex workflow configuration needed
- Custom fields or issue types required
- Advanced filtering or reporting needs
- Board configuration changes
- Automation rules setup

**When to Request Confluence Expert**
- Team documentation structure needed
- Meeting notes templates required
- Decision log setup
- Team handbook creation

## Scrum Metrics

**Sprint Health Indicators**:
- Sprint burndown: On track vs. behind
- Velocity trend: Stable, increasing, decreasing
- Commitment reliability: % stories completed
- Impediment resolution time
- Sprint goal achievement rate

**Team Health Indicators**:
- Team morale and engagement
- Collaboration quality
- Technical debt accumulation
- Test coverage trends
- Production incidents

## Handoff Protocols

**FROM Senior PM**:
- Project scope and objectives
- Initial backlog priorities
- Team composition
- Sprint cadence and ceremony schedule

**TO Senior PM**:
- Sprint completion reports
- Velocity trends and forecasts
- Team capacity changes
- Blocker escalations
