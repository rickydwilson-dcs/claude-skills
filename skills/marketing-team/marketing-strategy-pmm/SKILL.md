## Python Tools

This skill currently has no Python automation tools. All capabilities are delivered through strategic frameworks, templates, and reference guides designed for product marketing and go-to-market planning.

**Why No Tools?**
Product marketing is primarily a strategic and creative discipline that relies on market insights, competitive intelligence, and stakeholder collaboration rather than algorithmic analysis. The frameworks and templates provided offer more value than automated tools for positioning, messaging, and GTM strategy work.

**Available Resources Instead:**
- Strategic frameworks in `references/frameworks.md`
- Ready-to-use templates in `references/templates.md`
- Integration with HubSpot, Gong, and other PMM tools

## Best Practices

### Positioning Strategy
- Start with customer interviews (10-15 minimum)
- Use April Dunford methodology (proven framework)
- Test messaging before full rollout
- Refresh quarterly based on market feedback
- Keep one-liner under 15 words

### Competitive Intelligence
- Update battlecards monthly (or when competitor launches)
- Review 5-10 G2/Capterra reviews per month per competitor
- Listen to competitive sales calls (Gong/Chorus)
- Sign up for competitor trials quarterly
- Track win rate by competitor in HubSpot

### Launch Execution
- Start planning 8 weeks before (Tier 1 launches)
- Set clear success metrics before launch
- Monitor daily for first week post-launch
- Conduct win/loss analysis 30 days after
- Document learnings for next launch

### Sales Enablement
- Monthly enablement calls with sales team
- Quarterly deep-dive training workshops
- Keep sales decks under 20 slides
- Demo scripts should be 30-45 minutes
- Update battlecards before every major competitive deal

See [frameworks.md](references/frameworks.md) for detailed frameworks and [templates.md](references/templates.md) for ready-to-use assets.
