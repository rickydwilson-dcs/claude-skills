## Pillar-Cluster Content Model

### Concept
The pillar-cluster model organizes content into topic hierarchies that signal expertise to search engines and create clear navigation paths for users.

### Structure
```
Pillar Page (Broad Topic)
├── Cluster Content 1 (Specific Subtopic)
├── Cluster Content 2 (Specific Subtopic)
├── Cluster Content 3 (Specific Subtopic)
└── Cluster Content 4 (Specific Subtopic)
```

### Pillar Page Characteristics
- **Length:** 3,000-5,000 words
- **Scope:** Comprehensive overview of broad topic
- **Structure:** Multiple H2 sections, each linking to cluster content
- **Keywords:** Targets high-volume, competitive terms
- **Intent:** Informational/educational

### Cluster Content Characteristics
- **Length:** 1,500-2,500 words
- **Scope:** Deep dive on specific subtopic
- **Linking:** Links back to pillar page + related clusters
- **Keywords:** Targets long-tail, specific terms
- **Intent:** Varies (informational, commercial, transactional)

### Implementation Steps
1. Identify core topics (pillars) aligned with business goals
2. Research subtopics and cluster keywords
3. Create pillar page framework
4. Develop cluster content systematically
5. Implement internal linking architecture
6. Monitor and expand based on performance

## Keyword Research Methodology

### Phase 1: Seed Keywords
- Business/product terms
- Competitor analysis
- Industry terminology
- Customer language (from support, reviews)

### Phase 2: Expansion
- Related searches
- "People also ask" queries
- Long-tail variations
- Question-based keywords
- Modifier combinations (best, how to, guide, etc.)

### Phase 3: Clustering
- Group by semantic similarity
- Identify topic themes
- Map search intent
- Prioritize clusters by business value

### Phase 4: Prioritization
Use the **SCOPE Framework**:
- **S**earch Volume: Monthly search demand
- **C**ompetition: Difficulty to rank
- **O**pportunity: SERP feature potential
- **P**rofit: Business value/conversion potential
- **E**xpertise: Team capability to create content

### Priority Score Formula
```
Priority = (Volume Score × 0.25) + (Competition Score × 0.25) +
           (Opportunity Score × 0.2) + (Profit Score × 0.2) +
           (Expertise Score × 0.1)
```
