```markdown
# Q2 2025 Product Team OKRs - Growth

**Cascades From:** Company Objective - Expand Market Leadership
**Team:** Core Product Team
**Owner:** Sarah Chen, VP Product

---

### Objective: Accelerate new user acquisition and activation

**How This Supports Company OKR:**
Directly contributes to Company KR1 (Grow revenue to $50M ARR) by increasing top-of-funnel signups and improving conversion to paid.

**Key Result 1:** Increase monthly signups from 5,000 to 10,000
- **Baseline:** 5,000 signups/month (Mar 2025)
- **Target:** 10,000 signups/month (Jun 2025)
- **Tracking:** Amplitude Dashboard - Acquisition Funnel
- **Owner:** Mike Rodriguez, PM - Growth
- **Initiatives:**
  - Launch self-serve signup flow (remove sales contact requirement)
  - Implement product-led growth onboarding
  - Add Google/GitHub OAuth for faster signup
  - Launch referral program (give $10, get $10)

**Key Result 2:** Improve signup-to-activation rate from 40% to 60%
- **Baseline:** 40% reach "aha moment" within 7 days (Mar 2025)
- **Target:** 60% activation rate (Jun 2025)
- **Tracking:** Mixpanel - Activation Cohorts
- **Owner:** Alex Kim, PM - Onboarding
- **Initiatives:**
  - Interactive product tour (first-time user experience)
  - Smart templates based on use case
  - In-app contextual help and tooltips
  - Reduce time-to-first-value from 4 days to 1 day

**Key Result 3:** Achieve 30% month-over-month growth in viral coefficient
- **Baseline:** K-factor 0.8 (Mar 2025)
- **Target:** K-factor 1.2 (Jun 2025)
- **Tracking:** Custom Analytics - Viral Loop Dashboard
- **Owner:** Sarah Chen, VP Product
- **Initiatives:**
  - Team collaboration features (invite teammates)
  - Public sharing with branded landing pages
  - Export with watermark (leads to signup)
  - Integration marketplace (network effects)

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Self-serve signups reduce lead quality | High | Medium | Implement lead scoring, auto-route high-value leads to sales |
| Viral features cannibalize paid plans | High | Low | Set sharing limits on free tier, premium features for paid |
| Engineering bandwidth insufficient | Medium | High | Prioritize ruthlessly, cut scope if needed, add contractors |

## Dependencies

- **Blocked By:**
  - Auth system refactor (Engineering Platform Team) - ETA Apr 15
  - Design system components (Design Team) - ETA Apr 1
- **Blocking:**
  - Sales team training on new signup flow (need 2 weeks lead time)

## Resources Required

- **Engineering:** 3 engineers × 12 weeks = 36 eng-weeks
- **Design:** 1 designer × 12 weeks = 12 design-weeks
- **Data:** Analytics support for dashboards (2 weeks)
- **Marketing:** Launch campaign coordination (ongoing)
