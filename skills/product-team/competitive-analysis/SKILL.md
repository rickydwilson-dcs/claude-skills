## Overview

The Competitive Analysis skill provides a structured framework for comparing your skills, commands, agents, and features against competitors. It enables systematic evaluation using weighted scoring dimensions and generates actionable insights for product strategy.

### Key Capabilities

| Capability | Description | Output |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Scorecard Generation** | Multi-dimensional comparison with weighted scoring | Visual scorecard with ratings |
| **Gap Analysis** | Identify what competitors have that you don't | Prioritized gap list |
| **Advantage Identification** | Document your competitive strengths | Differentiation matrix |
| **Adoption Prioritization** | Rank improvements by impact and effort | Action roadmap |

### When to Use This Skill

- Evaluating new market entrants or competitor updates
- Planning product roadmap priorities
- Identifying feature gaps before releases
- Documenting competitive differentiation for stakeholders
- Strategic planning sessions

---

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Competitive Scorecard Generation

**Purpose**: Create a comprehensive comparison scorecard between your product and competitors.

**Trigger**: User provides competitor code/documentation for analysis

**Process**:

1. **Discovery Phase**
   - Inventory competitor's capabilities (skills, commands, agents, features)
   - Catalog your own capabilities for comparison
   - Build comparison matrix with matched items

2. **Analysis Phase**
   - Score each dimension (6 weighted categories)
   - Apply scoring rubric (1-5 stars)
   - Calculate weighted totals

3. **Scoring Dimensions**:

   | Dimension | Weight | What to Evaluate |
   |-----------|--------|------------------|
   | Documentation Completeness | 20% | Metadata, sections, examples, clarity |
   | Tool/Script Quality | 20% | CLI support, error handling, testing |
   | Workflow Coverage | 15% | Number of workflows, depth, practicality |
   | Architecture | 15% | Modularity, portability, dependencies |
   | Automation | 15% | Auto-generation, validation, CI/CD |
   | Reference Depth | 15% | Knowledge bases, templates, examples |

4. **Output Generation**
   - Generate visual scorecard (ASCII box format)
   - Create feature comparison table
   - Summarize overall position (AHEAD / EVEN / BEHIND)

**Deliverable**: Competitive scorecard with visual summary and detailed breakdown

**Example Output**:
```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 COMPETITIVE SCORECARD                      │
│                 US (claude-skills) vs THEM (Competitor)    │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  🏆 WE WIN:     12 areas  (48%)  - Our advantages         │
│  🤝 TIE:         8 areas  (32%)  - At parity              │
│  🔄 DIFFERENT:   3 areas  (12%)  - Neither better         │
│  ❌ THEY WIN:    2 areas  (8%)   - Gaps to address        │
│                                                            │
│  Overall Position: WE ARE AHEAD                            │
│  Confidence: HIGH                                          │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Workflow 2: Feature Gap Analysis

**Purpose**: Identify gaps in your product compared to competitors and prioritize which to address.

**Trigger**: After scorecard generation or standalone gap assessment request

**Process**:

1. **Gap Identification** (Always label clearly as US vs THEM)
   - **THEY have, WE don't** → Gaps for us to fill
   - **WE have, THEY don't** → Our advantages to maintain
   - **Different approaches** → Neither better, just different
   - **THEY score higher** → Priority improvements for us

2. **Gap Categorization**

   | Category | Symbol | Action |
   |----------|--------|--------|
   | Critical Gap | 🔴 | Must address immediately |
   | Important Gap | 🟠 | Address in next quarter |
   | Nice-to-Have | 🟡 | Consider for roadmap |
   | Strategic Choice | ⚪ | Intentionally different |

3. **Impact Assessment**
   - User impact (1-5)
   - Competitive urgency (1-5)
   - Strategic alignment (1-5)
   - Implementation effort (1-5)

4. **Priority Calculation**
   ```
   Priority Score = (Impact × 0.4) + (Urgency × 0.3) + (Strategic × 0.2) + (1/Effort × 0.1)
   ```

**Deliverable**: Prioritized gap list with recommended actions

**Example Output**:

   - Features worth adopting from competitors
   - Improvements needed for parity
   - Innovations to leapfrog competition

2. **Evaluation Criteria**

   | Criterion | Weight | Description |
   |-----------|--------|-------------|
   | User Value | 30% | How much will users benefit? |
   | Competitive Impact | 25% | Does this close a critical gap? |
   | Strategic Fit | 20% | Does it align with our direction? |
   | Implementation Cost | 15% | Resources and time required |
   | Risk Level | 10% | Technical and market risks |

3. **Prioritization Matrix**
   ```

## Best Practices

### Before Analysis

1. **Gather Complete Data**: Ensure you have access to competitor's full codebase or documentation
2. **Define Scope**: Determine what you're comparing (skills, commands, agents, all)
3. **Establish Baseline**: Know your own inventory before comparing

### During Analysis

1. **Use Consistent Criteria**: Apply the same scoring rubric to both sides
2. **Document Assumptions**: Note any gaps in information
3. **Seek Objectivity**: Avoid bias toward your own product

### After Analysis

1. **Validate Findings**: Have stakeholders review the scorecard
2. **Prioritize Ruthlessly**: Focus on high-impact, low-effort items first
3. **Create Action Items**: Convert insights into backlog items
4. **Track Progress**: Revisit gaps quarterly
