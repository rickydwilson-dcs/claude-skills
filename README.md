## 🤖 Agent Catalog

**3 production agents** that orchestrate skills and provide guided workflows (v1.0):

Agents are workflow orchestrators that intelligently invoke skills, coordinate Python tools, and guide you through complex multi-step processes. While skills provide the tools and knowledge, agents provide the intelligence to use them effectively.

| Agent | Domain | Skills Used | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Marketing Agents** ||||
| [cs-content-creator](agents/marketing/cs-content-creator.md) | Marketing | content-creator | Create SEO-optimized marketing content with brand voice consistency |
| [cs-demand-gen-specialist](agents/marketing/cs-demand-gen-specialist.md) | Marketing | marketing-demand-acquisition | Lead generation and conversion funnel optimization |
| **Product Agents** ||||
| [cs-product-manager](agents/product/cs-product-manager.md) | Product | product-manager-toolkit | RICE prioritization, roadmap generation, customer discovery |

### Agents vs Skills

**Skills** = Tools + Knowledge + Templates
- 26 Pandora-focused skills
- 77 automation tools
- Domain expertise packaged

**Agents** = Workflow Orchestrators
- Invoke skills intelligently
- Guide multi-step processes
- Coordinate tools and knowledge

**Example:** The [cs-content-creator](agents/marketing/cs-content-creator.md) agent uses the content-creator skill's Python tools (brand_voice_analyzer.py, seo_optimizer.py) plus knowledge bases (brand guidelines, SEO frameworks) to guide you through professional content creation workflows.

## 🏗️ Skill Architecture

Each skill package follows a consistent, modular structure:

```
{skill-category}/
└── {skill-name}/
    ├── SKILL.md                          # Master documentation
    ├── scripts/                          # Python CLI tools
    │   ├── {tool_name}.py               # Executable analysis tools
    │   └── ...
    ├── references/                       # Knowledge bases
    │   ├── {framework_name}.md          # Curated guidelines

        ├── {template_name}.md           # Ready-to-use templates
        └── ...
```

### Design Principles

1. **Self-Contained** - Each skill is fully independent and deployable
2. **Documentation-Driven** - Success depends on clear, actionable documentation
3. **Algorithm Over AI** - Use deterministic analysis (code) when possible for speed and reliability
4. **Template-Heavy** - Provide ready-to-use frameworks users can customize
5. **Platform-Specific** - Focus on specific, actionable advice over generic best practices

### Component Responsibilities
