python scripts/gdpr_compliance_checker.py processing_inventory.json

# 3. Generate detailed JSON report for compliance dashboard
python scripts/gdpr_compliance_checker.py processing_inventory.json \
  --output json --verbose --file compliance_report.json

# 4. Export CSV for spreadsheet analysis and trend tracking
python scripts/gdpr_compliance_checker.py processing_inventory.json \
  -o csv -f quarterly_compliance.csv

# 5. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline (exits with code 3 if critical issues)
python scripts/gdpr_compliance_checker.py processing_inventory.json -o json || \
  echo "Critical GDPR issues detected - review required"
