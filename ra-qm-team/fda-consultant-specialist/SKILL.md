## FDA Submission Planner Tool

### Overview
The **FDA Submission Planner** (`fda_submission_planner.py`) is a production-ready Python tool that helps medical device companies plan and track FDA regulatory submissions. It analyzes device characteristics, recommends optimal submission pathways, generates document checklists, calculates realistic timelines, and provides FDA correspondence tracking templates.

### Key Features
1. **Device Classification Analysis**: Automatically classifies devices as Class I, II, or III based on FDA criteria
2. **Submission Pathway Recommendation**: Recommends optimal FDA pathway (510(k), PMA, De Novo, HDE) with detailed reasoning
3. **Document Checklist Generation**: Creates comprehensive document checklists with CFR references specific to submission type
4. **Timeline Calculation**: Estimates realistic submission timelines with key milestones and projected clearance dates
5. **FDA Correspondence Tracking**: Provides templates for tracking FDA interactions (Q-Subs, RFIs, meetings)

### Supported Submission Types
- **510(k) Traditional**: Standard substantial equivalence demonstration with predicate device comparison
- **510(k) Special**: Manufacturing-only changes to previously cleared device (30-day review)
- **510(k) Abbreviated**: Devices with FDA guidance documents available
- **PMA (Premarket Approval)**: Class III devices requiring clinical trials (180-day review)
- **De Novo**: Novel devices with no predicate establishing new device classification (150-day review)
- **HDE (Humanitarian Device Exemption)**: Devices for rare diseases affecting <8,000 patients/year

#### Workflow 1: New Device Submission Planning
```bash
# 1. Create device information file
cp assets/sample_device_info.json my_device.json
vim my_device.json  # Edit with your device details

# 2. Generate initial plan
python scripts/fda_submission_planner.py my_device.json -v

# 3. Review classification and pathway recommendation

# 4. Export detailed plan for team
python scripts/fda_submission_planner.py my_device.json -o json -f submission_plan.json

# 5. Generate document checklist for assignment
python scripts/fda_submission_planner.py my_device.json -o csv -f checklist.csv
```

#### Workflow 2: Pre-Submission Meeting Preparation
```bash
# Generate comprehensive submission plan before Q-Sub meeting
python scripts/fda_submission_planner.py my_device.json -v -f presub_plan.txt

# Use output to:
# - Confirm submission pathway with FDA
# - Discuss document requirements
# - Clarify testing requirements
# - Establish communication plan
```

#### Workflow 3: Regulatory Strategy Development
```bash
# Compare multiple pathway scenarios
python scripts/fda_submission_planner.py scenario_510k.json -o json -f 510k_plan.json
python scripts/fda_submission_planner.py scenario_pma.json -o json -f pma_plan.json

# Analyze:

# - Resource requirements
# - Risk vs. speed tradeoffs
```

### Business Logic

#### Device Classification Algorithm
1. Analyzes intended use for life-sustaining/life-supporting keywords
2. Evaluates invasiveness and duration of contact
3. Assesses technological characteristics (software, AI/ML)
4. Applies FDA classification criteria
5. Returns Class I/II/III with risk level (Low/Moderate/High)

#### Submission Pathway Selection
1. **HDE Priority**: Checks rare disease criteria (<8,000 patients/year)
2. **PMA for Class III**: Novel technology or no predicate
3. **De Novo for Novel**: Class I/II devices without predicate
4. **Special 510(k)**: Manufacturing-only changes
5. **Abbreviated 510(k)**: FDA guidance available
6. **Traditional 510(k)**: Standard pathway with predicate

#### Timeline Calculation
- Pre-submission preparation: 60 days
- Q-Sub meeting (if complex): 75 days
- FDA review: 30-180 days (depends on submission type)
- RFI response buffer: 30 days
- Decision processing: 5 days

### Regulatory Context

The tool implements FDA regulatory requirements from:
- **21 CFR Part 807**: Premarket Notification (510(k))
- **21 CFR Part 814**: Premarket Approval (PMA)
- **21 CFR Part 860**: Device Classification
- **21 CFR Part 820**: Quality System Regulation
- **FDA Guidance Documents**: Device-specific and pathway-specific guidance

### Limitations & Disclaimers

1. **Not a substitute for regulatory consulting**: Tool provides planning guidance, not regulatory approval
2. **Device classification**: Recommendations based on provided information; FDA has final classification authority
3. **Timelines are estimates**: Actual FDA review times vary based on complexity and FDA workload
4. **Document checklists**: General requirements; specific devices may need additional documentation
5. **Legal compliance**: Tool does not constitute legal or regulatory advice

### Troubleshooting

**Issue**: "Error: Input file not found"
```bash
# Verify file path is correct
ls -la my_device.json

# Use absolute path if needed
python scripts/fda_submission_planner.py /full/path/to/my_device.json
```

**Issue**: "Error: Invalid JSON in input file"
```bash
# Validate JSON syntax
python -m json.tool my_device.json

# Common issues:
# - Missing quotes on strings
# - Trailing commas
# - Unescaped quotes in strings
```

**Issue**: Incorrect classification
```bash
# Run with verbose mode to see analysis
python scripts/fda_submission_planner.py my_device.json -v

# Check device characteristics:
# - intended_use keywords
# - invasiveness level
# - duration_of_contact
# - technological_characteristics
```

**Issue**: Wrong submission pathway recommended
```bash
# Verify device information:
# - predicate_device.identified = true/false
# - novel_technology = true/false
# - rare_disease_indication and patient population
# - guidance_document_available = true/false
```

### Integration with Other Tools

**Project Management Systems**:
```bash
# Export JSON for Jira/Asana/Monday integration
python scripts/fda_submission_planner.py device.json -o json -f plan.json

# Parse milestones as tasks/issues
jq '.results.timeline.milestones[]' plan.json
```

**Quality Management Systems**:
```bash
# Export document checklist for QMS integration
python scripts/fda_submission_planner.py device.json -o csv -f checklist.csv

# Import into eQMS for document control
```

**Regulatory Information Management Systems (RIMS)**:
```bash
# Generate complete submission plan
python scripts/fda_submission_planner.py device.json -o json -f rims_import.json

# Import into RIMS for tracking and compliance
```
