- **Routine Inspection:** Biennial inspection (every 2 years typical)
- **Pre-Approval Inspection (PAI):** Before PMA or initial 510(k) clearance
- **Surveillance Inspection:** Post-market monitoring

**Inspection Phases:**

**Phase 1: Opening Meeting**
- FDA investigator presents credentials
- Inspection scope discussed
- Key personnel identified
- Facility tour conducted

**Phase 2: Quality System Review**
- Management responsibility
- Design controls (if applicable)
- Document controls
- Purchasing controls
- CAPA system

**Phase 3: Device-Specific Review**
- Device history records
- Production processes
- Validation records
- Complaint files
- MDR reports

**Phase 4: Closing Meeting**
- FDA presents findings
- Form FDA 483 issued (if deficiencies found)
- Observations discussed
- Response timeline provided (typically 15 business days)

### Common FDA 483 Observations

**Top 10 Most Common:**
1. CAPA system deficiencies (820.100)
2. Design control deficiencies (820.30)
3. Management responsibility issues (820.20)
4. Complaint handling deficiencies (820.198)
5. Document control issues (820.40)
6. Process validation inadequacies (820.75)

### 483 Response Best Practices

**Response Timeline:**
- 15 business days typical (request extension if needed)
- Respond even if disagreeing with observations

**Response Structure:**
1. **Observation Restatement:** Repeat FDA observation
2. **Root Cause Analysis:** Identify why deficiency occurred
3. **Immediate Correction:** What was fixed immediately
4. **Corrective Action:** Systematic fix to prevent recurrence
5. **Verification:** How effectiveness will be verified
6. **Timeline:** Completion dates for each action

**Response Quality:**
- Address root cause, not just symptom

|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Scope** | US market | International |
| **Design Controls** | Class II/III | All classes |
| **Management Review** | Required | Required |
| **CAPA** | Required | Required |
| **Risk Management** | Implied | ISO 14971 required |
| **Post-Market Surveillance** | Complaint handling | Comprehensive PMS |
| **Supplier Controls** | Evaluation required | Risk-based approach |
| **Validation** | Process validation | Process validation + software |

**Key Differences:**
- ISO 13485 more comprehensive for international markets
- QSR sufficient for US-only sales
- ISO 13485 requires explicit risk management (ISO 14971)
- ISO 13485 has more detailed PMS requirements
