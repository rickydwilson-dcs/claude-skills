  Clause_5: 100.0%
  Clause_6: 80.0%
  Clause_7: 90.0%
  Clause_8: 92.3%
```

### Workflow Integration

**Step 1: Define Audit Scope**

# Create audit_scope.json with audit details
# Include focus areas and previous findings
```

**Step 2: Generate Checklist**
```bash
python scripts/audit_checklist_generator.py audit_scope.json -o text -f checklist.txt
```

**Step 3: Review and Customize**
```bash
# Review generated checklist
# Add organization-specific questions
# Customize evidence requirements
```

**Step 4: Conduct Audit**
```bash
# Use checklist during audit execution
# Document findings directly on checklist
# Note conformities and nonconformities
```

**Step 5: Export Results**
```bash
# Export findings to CSV for tracking
python scripts/audit_checklist_generator.py audit_scope.json -o csv -f findings.csv
```

### Best Practices

**Audit Planning**
- Run generator 2 weeks before audit
- Review and customize questions for organization context
- Share checklist with audit team for preparation
- Update previous findings before generation

**Focus Areas**
- Limit focus areas to 3-5 clauses for targeted audits
- Use full checklist for certification/surveillance audits
- Prioritize clauses with recent quality issues
- Include clauses with regulatory updates

**Risk Areas**
- Update risk areas based on management review
- Include processes with high customer complaints
- Add areas with frequent nonconformities
- Consider regulatory inspection history

**Previous Findings**
- Update finding status before each audit
- Close verified findings to reduce follow-up load
- Track CAR numbers for traceability
- Document root causes in finding descriptions

**Output Format Selection**
- Text: Manual audits, paper-based systems
- JSON: Integration with audit management software
- CSV: Tracking findings in spreadsheets, collaborative tools

### Sample Files

**Sample audit scope:**
```bash
scripts/sample_audit_scope.json
```

**Generate sample checklist:**
```bash
python scripts/audit_checklist_generator.py scripts/sample_audit_scope.json
```

### Troubleshooting

**Error: Input file not found**
- Verify JSON file path is correct
- Use absolute path if relative path fails

**Error: Invalid JSON format**
- Validate JSON syntax using online validator
- Check for missing commas, brackets, quotes
- Ensure proper string escaping

**Low clause coverage percentage**
- Check if focus_areas limits questions too much
- Remove or expand focus_areas for full coverage
- Verify expected coverage thresholds in metrics

**No previous finding follow-ups**
- Ensure findings have status "OPEN" or "CAR"
- Set follow_up_required: true in finding data
- Check finding clause matches audit scope

### Advanced Usage

**Targeted Design Control Audit:**
```json
{
  "audit_scope": {"audit_type": "Design Control Audit"},
  "focus_areas": ["7.3"],
  "risk_areas": ["Design Controls", "Design Validation"]
}
```

**CAPA System Effectiveness Audit:**
```json
{
  "audit_scope": {"audit_type": "CAPA Audit"},
  "focus_areas": ["8.5"],
  "previous_findings": [/* all open CAPA findings */]
}
```

**Pre-Certification Audit:**
```json
{
  "audit_scope": {"audit_type": "Pre-Certification Audit"},
  "focus_areas": [],  // Full coverage
  "risk_areas": ["Design Controls", "CAPA", "Complaint Handling", "Regulatory Reporting"]
}
```
