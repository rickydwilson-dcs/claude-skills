  This session contains outputs migrated from the legacy flat directory structure.
  
  Each output has been moved from output/{category}/ to this session directory.
  File timestamps and names have been preserved.
  
  Next Steps:
  1. Review outputs and determine which are still relevant
  2. Update ticket/project fields if known
  3. Promote important outputs to Confluence
  4. Archive or delete after 30 days if no longer needed
