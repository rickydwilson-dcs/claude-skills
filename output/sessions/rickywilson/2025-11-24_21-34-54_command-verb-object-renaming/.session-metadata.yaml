# Key Decisions
decisions:
  - decision: Adopt verb.object naming pattern for all commands
    rationale: Users think in terms of actions (verbs) they want to perform
    impact: Breaking change - all command invocations must update

  - decision: Use plural form for cleanup.branches
    rationale: Command performs batch cleanup on multiple branches
    verification: Checked command content confirmed multiple branch handling

  - decision: Use test.command not sample.command
    rationale: The action is 'test' - command name should reflect primary action
    result: More intuitive and clear command naming

# Notes
notes: |
  Successfully completed the full migration of all 12 production commands to verb.object naming pattern.

  Key accomplishments:
  - Updated test fixtures to demonstrate correct pattern
  - Removed all speckit artifacts (specs/, .specify/)
  - Relocated misplaced commands from .claude/commands/
  - Renamed all 12 production commands
  - Updated all documentation (6 files)
  - Achieved 100% pattern compliance
  - Migrated session tracking to user-based structure
  - Updated CLAUDE.md with session tracking documentation

  Session Structure Migration:
  - Moved from flat output/{timestamp}_{description}/ to output/sessions/{user}/{session-id}/
  - Created .session-metadata.yaml with structured tracking
  - Updated .current-session pointer to new format
  - Established standard for all future sessions

  This establishes the standard that all commands must follow verb.object pattern:
  - audit.dependencies (not analysis.dependency-audit)
  - generate.tests (not generation.test-generate)
  - write.commit-message (not git.commit-assist)

  Breaking change requires users to update command invocations.
