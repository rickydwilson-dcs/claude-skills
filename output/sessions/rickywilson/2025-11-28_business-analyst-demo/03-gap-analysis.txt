DETAILED GAPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[GAP-001] Step 2: Send Welcome Package
  Severity:    LOW
  Category:    Orphaned Input
  Description: Input 'Customer record' has no clear source from previous steps
  Impact:      Unclear where this input comes from
  Recommendation: Identify source step that produces this input

[GAP-002] Step 3: Technical Setup
  Severity:    LOW
  Category:    Orphaned Input
  Description: Input 'Technical requirements' has no clear source from previous steps
  Impact:      Unclear where this input comes from
  Recommendation: Identify source step that produces this input

[GAP-003] Step 4: Data Migration
  Severity:    LOW
  Category:    Orphaned Input
  Description: Input 'Source data files' has no clear source from previous steps
  Impact:      Unclear where this input comes from
  Recommendation: Identify source step that produces this input

[GAP-004] Step 5: User Training
  Severity:    LOW
  Category:    Orphaned Input
  Description: Input 'Training curriculum' has no clear source from previous steps
  Impact:      Unclear where this input comes from
  Recommendation: Identify source step that produces this input

[GAP-005] Step 6: Go-Live
  Severity:    LOW
  Category:    Orphaned Input
  Description: Input 'All checklist items' has no clear source from previous steps
  Impact:      Unclear where this input comes from
  Recommendation: Identify source step that produces this input

[GAP-006] Overall Process
  Severity:    CRITICAL
  Category:    No Error Handling
  Description: Process has no documented error handling or exception paths
  Impact:      No recovery mechanism for failures, unclear escalation
  Recommendation: Add error handling steps and exception paths throughout process

[GAP-007] Step 2: Send Welcome Package
  Severity:    MEDIUM
  Category:    Bottleneck Duration
  Description: Step has long duration: 960 minutes (16.0 hours)
  Impact:      Process delay, potential bottleneck
  Recommendation: Review step for automation or parallelization opportunities

[GAP-008] Step 3: Technical Setup
  Severity:    MEDIUM
  Category:    Bottleneck Duration
  Description: Step has long duration: 2400 minutes (40.0 hours)
  Impact:      Process delay, potential bottleneck
  Recommendation: Review step for automation or parallelization opportunities

[GAP-009] Step 4: Data Migration
  Severity:    MEDIUM
  Category:    Bottleneck Duration
  Description: Step has long duration: 3360 minutes (56.0 hours)
  Impact:      Process delay, potential bottleneck
  Recommendation: Review step for automation or parallelization opportunities

  Severity:    HIGH
  Category:    No Validation
  Description: Process has no quality checks or validation steps
  Impact:      No quality assurance, potential for errors
  Recommendation: Add validation checkpoints at critical stages


RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Address 1 critical gap(s) immediately - these represent significant process risks
2. Review process timing and identify optimization opportunities (4 gaps)
3. Implement error handling and exception paths throughout process
