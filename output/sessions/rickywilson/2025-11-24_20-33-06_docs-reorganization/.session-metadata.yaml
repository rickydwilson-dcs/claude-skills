# Key Decisions
decisions:
  - decision: Reorganize docs into modular structure
    rationale: Separate concerns (catalogs, development, guides, reference, standards)
    impact: Easier navigation and maintenance

  - decision: Remove all speckit workflow artifacts
    rationale: Personal workflow tools, not production library content
    impact: Clean separation, reduced confusion

  - decision: Simplify standards filenames
    rationale: Remove redundant "-standards" suffix from all files
    impact: Cleaner, more concise naming

# Notes
notes: |
  Major documentation reorganization session that restructured the entire docs/ directory
  and removed all speckit workflow artifacts.

  Key accomplishments:
  - Reorganized docs/ into modular structure (catalogs, development, guides, reference, standards)
  - Removed 8 speckit command files from .claude/commands/
  - Removed .specify/ directory (templates, scripts, memory)
  - Removed specs/ directory (workflow outputs)
  - Simplified all standards filenames (removed "-standards" suffix)
  - Backed up original documentation before changes
  - Created reorganization scripts for future reference

  This work preceded the command renaming to verb.object pattern and established
  the foundation for the cleaner documentation structure.
