# Key Decisions
decisions:
  - decision: Use multi-phase approach for migration
    rationale: Allows validation at each step before proceeding
    impact: Safer migration with ability to rollback

  - decision: Add website display fields to all agents
    rationale: Enable agent catalog/website presentation
    impact: Consistent metadata across all 28 agents

# Notes
notes: |
  Successfully completed website fields migration across all 28 agent files.

  Migration added the following fields to agent YAML frontmatter:
  - title: Human-readable agent title
  - subdomain: Sub-categorization within domain
  - version: Semantic versioning (v1.0.0)
  - author: Attribution field
  - contributors: List of contributors
  - created: Creation date
  - updated: Last update date
  - license: MIT license specification

  The migration was executed in 4 phases with dry-run validation
  before applying changes. All 28 agents were successfully updated.

  This session was retroactively created on 2025-11-28 to properly
  archive the migration reports according to session tracking standards.
